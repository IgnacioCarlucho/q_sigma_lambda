## Double Q($\sigma$) and Q($\sigma, \lambda$): Unifying Reinforcement Learning Control Algorithms

This repository includes code for the paper:

> Double Q($\sigma$) and Q($\sigma, \lambda$): Unifying Reinforcement Learning Control Algorithms

It contains python implementations of Double Q($\sigma$) and Q($\sigma, \lambda$). These algorithms generalize Q-Learning, Sarsa and Q($\sigma$) and can achieve better performance. Read the paper at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01569) for more information.
